1 Zero Downtime Patching
------------------------------
This patch has been marked as eligible for Zero Downtime Patching. 
The type of Zero Downtime Patching supported by this patch is FMW_ROLLING_ORACLE_HOME.

With Zero Downtime Patching, a Patch can be applied to a system in a manner
that does not incur any downtime. This ensures that the system can remain
available and functioning during the patching process. Certain
pre-requisites, however, must be met before the patch can be applied.

For more information, consult the My Oracle Support MOS Note: 1942159.1 
 
2 Prerequisites
----------------
Ensure that you meet the following requirements before you install or
deinstall the patch:

1. Before applying the non-mandatory patches, ensure that you have the
exact symptoms described in the bug.


2. Oracle Fusion Middleware 12.2.1 products are installed with OPatch NextGen 13.3 to apply interim patches.

The OPatch utility should be updated over time to resolve known issues.

You can check your version using the following command:

ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch version

Checking Patch 6880880, if a new version is available , download "OUI NextGen 13.3" for your platform.

Review the following for more information:
Doc ID 1587524.1, "Using OUI NextGen OPatch 13 for Oracle Fusion Middleware 12c (12.1.2+)"
https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1587524.1

For Oracle Fusion Middleware OPatch usage, refer to the URL below which
redirects to the latest FMW 12c document:
"Oracle Fusion Middleware Patching With OPatch"
 http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=fmw122100&id=OPATC 

3. Verify the OUI Inventory.
OPatch needs access to a valid OUI inventory to apply patches.

Note: This needs the ORACLE_HOME to be set(refer section "2. Pre-Installation Instructions")
prior to run the below commands:

Validate the OUI inventory with the following commands:

$ opatch lsinventory -jre $ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/jdk/jre

Note:
All OPatch commands should be run with -jre option.
Make sure the JDK version you use is the certified version for your product.

If the command errors out, contact Oracle Support and work to validate
and verify the inventory setup before proceeding.

4. Confirm the executables appear in your system PATH.

The patching process will use the unzip and the OPatch executables. After
setting the ORACLE_HOME environment, confirm if the following executables
exist, before proceeding to the next step:

- opatch
- unzip

If either of these executables do not show in the PATH, correct the
problem before proceeding.

5. Create a location for storing the unzipped patch. This location
will be referred to later in the document as PATCH_TOP.

NOTE: On WINDOWS, the preferred location is the drive root directory.
For example, "C:\PATCH_TOP" and avoid choosing locations like,
"C:\Documents and Settings\username\PATCH_TOP".
This is necessary due to the 256 characters limitation on windows
platform.

3 Pre-Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

1. Set the ORACLE_HOME environment variable to the directory where you have installed ORACLE WEBLOGIC SERVER.



4 Installation Instructions
---------------------------

1. Unzip the patch zip file into the PATCH_TOP.

$ unzip -d PATCH_TOP p24388370_122120_Generic.zip

NOTE: On WINDOWS, the unzip command has a limitation of 256 characters in the path name.
If you encounter this, please use an alternate ZIP utility like 7-Zip to unzip the patch.

For example: To unzip using 7-zip, run the command:
"c:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" x  p24388370_122120_Generic.zip

2. Set your current directory to the directory where the patch is located.

$ cd PATCH_TOP/24388370

3. Run OPatch to apply the patch.

$ opatch apply

Note:
-----
When OPatch starts, it validates the patch and makes sure that there are no
conflicts with the software already installed in the ORACLE_HOME.

In case of opatch conflict, you will see a warning message similar to the one mentioned below:

Interim Patch XXXX has Conflict with patch(es) [ YYYY ] in OH ...
Conflict patches: YYYY
Patch(es) YYYY conflict with the patch currently being installed (XXXX).
If you continue, patch(es) YYYY will be rolled back and the new patch (XXXX) will be installed.

If a merge of the new patch (XXXX) and the conflicting patch(es) ( YYYY) is required,contact Oracle Support Services and request a Merged patch.

Do you want to proceed? [y|n]
n

You must stop the patch installation and contact oracle support on how to proceed.

5 Post-Installation Instructions
---------------------------------

NONE

6 Deinstallation Instructions
------------------------------

If you experience any problems after installing this patch, remove the patch as
follows:

1. Make sure to follow the same Prerequisites or pre-install steps (if any)
when deinstalling a patch.
This includes setting up any environment variables like ORACLE_HOME and
verifying the OUI inventory before deinstalling.

2. Change to the directory where the patch was unzipped.

$ cd PATCH_TOP/24388370

3. Run OPatch to deinstall the patch.

$ opatch rollback -id  24388370

7 Post Deinstallation Instructions
-----------------------------------
Restart all servers (AdminServer and all Managed server(s)).

This is necessary to redeploy the original applications and bring the
environment back to it's original state.
